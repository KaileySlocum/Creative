        <h2 style="font-size: 30px; padding-left:10px;">Lane Community College, Spring Term 2020</h2>
        <p>I took this class during Spring term 2020. My professor was <a href="https://www.studiomeyers.com/about" target="_blank" style="color:black;">Jon Meyers</a>, 
            a Pacific Northwest Photographer and owner of StudioMeyers. 
            I learned so much about photography from this class, and got to know 
            my new DSLR camera very well by the end of the term. Here's some of my work!

        <p>Kathleen Clemmons</p>
        <p>After some research on various photography forms, I chose macro photography, 
             which especially piqued my interest. I have always loved taking pictures 
            of the flowers in my backyard, and I am fascinated by professional photographs 
            that enlarge tiny objects so that we can see the miniscule details of flowers, 
            insects, and other small parts of nature.
        </p>
        <p>I came across a professional photographer by the name of <a href="https://www.kathleenclemonsphotography.com/" target="_blank" style="color:black;">Kathleen Clemons</a>, 
            who specializes in macro flower photography but is also known for her 
            impressions, portraits, landscapes, textures, and more. I was drawn to 
            her photography style because her floral photos in particular have a beautiful 
            soft, dreamy look. Each of her photos is so picturesque, and many of them look 
            like a painting. Kathleen achieves this affect in her photos by using special 
            lenses from a company called <a href="https://lensbaby.com/" target="_blank" style="color:black;">Lensbaby</a> that makes special-effects camera lenses 
            for SLR cameras. This company even gave her the nickname “Lensbaby Guru”!
        </p>
        <p>Kathleen Clemons is skilled at utilizing natural light in her unique photos. 
            She lives in Maine, but her work is known worldwide through Corbis and 
            Getty Images and other sites. She helps people improve their photography 
            skills by leading private mentoring, workshops, online classes, photography 
            conferences, and filmed classes on Creative Live and Craftsy.

    <article class="blogarticle">
        <h2 id="Shutter">Week 3: ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed</h2>
        <p><b>What is the Aperture and the Shutter?</b></p>
        <p>Aperture and shutter speed are critical parts of the ‘exposure triangle’, a reference 
            to the balance of ISO, shutter speed, and aperture when taking photographs. 
            Aperture determines the amount of light that is allowed through the lens by 
            adjusting the size of the lens opening’s hole. This size is measured in f-stop 
            numbers. Smaller numbers refer to a wider hole and larger numbers refer to a narrower hole. 
        </p>
        <p>Shutter speed determines the length of time that the camera’s sensor is exposed to light. 
            The shutter is a ‘curtain’ that opens and closes in front of the sensor. Although 
            there are two main types of shutters (leaf shutter and focal plane shutter), the 
            focal plane shutter is more widely used in modern DSLR’s and is located directly in 
            front of the sensor. When the shutter is released, the mirror flicks out of the way 
            while two ‘curtains’ roll over the sensor, letting in a sliver of light across it. 
            Shutter speed numbers range from fast (large fractions like 1/400) to slow (whole numbers 
            like 5 seconds). The faster the shutter speed, the smaller the sliver between the ‘curtains’ 
            and the faster they slide across. Unfortunately, this shutter mechanism can create ‘leaning’ 
            or ‘warped’ objects in high-speed photographs due to ‘rolling shutter distortion’. 
        </p>
        <p><b>How do they affect my images?</b></p>
        <p>When adjusting aperture, larger f-stop numbers create a smaller hole opening, resulting in greater 
            depth of field, more of the image being in focus and less light entering the camera. On the 
            other hand, smaller f-stop numbers create a wider hole opening, resulting in shallower 
            depth of focus, less of the image being in focus, and more light entering the camera.
        </p>

        <figcaption>Landscape: larger aperture</figcaption>
        <p>When adjusting the shutter speed, longer speeds allow more light to reach the sensor, 
            capturing a longer moment of time, and blurring moving objects. A shorter speed lets 
            less light in, captures smaller moments of time and freezes more action.
        </p>
        <img src="./MUL105blog_Images/April 16, 2020-SlocumKailey_0703.jpg" alt="Sprinklers" class="img">
        <figcaption>Shutter speed: 1/4000</figcaption>
        <p><b>How can they work together?</b></p>
        <p>Each of the aspects in the exposure triangle affects the others, which is why finding 
            the perfect balance can be especially tricky. For example, a longer shutter speed 
            exposes the sensor to a lot more light, so it may need a larger f-stop number to 
            create a smaller aperture hole to compensate for that. Also, a smaller f-stop number 
            lets in more light through a wider hole, so a shorter shutter speed may be needed to 
            expose the sensor to less of that incoming light. If you need a certain shutter speed 
            for a fast-moving object, or a small f-stop number for a bokeh affect, the other component 
            can be adjusted to compensate.

        <figcaption>ISO 200 f5.6 1/320 - I used a higher shutter speed because the fern was 
            <br>waving in the wind; thus, I needed a smaller aperture and higher ISO.</figcaption>
        <img src="./MUL105blog_Images/April 15, 2020-SlocumKailey_0633.jpg" alt="Car Headlight" class="img">
        <figcaption>ISO 6400 f5.6 1/80 - I used a slow shutter speed and high ISO because this 
            <br>picture was taken in a dim garage.</figcaption>
        <p><b>How are they different? 
            <br>Why are they important physical parts of the camera system?</b></p>
        <p>Aperture affects the size of lens opening, while shutter speed affects the exposure of the sensor. 
            Both components affect how much light reaches the sensor, but aperture tends to specialize in 
            varying depths of field while shutter speed specializes in the capturing of motion.</p>
        <p><b>How can I use ISO to expand my ability to make photographs in different places 
            and under different condiditons?</b></p>
        <p>ISO determines the camera sensor’s sensitivity to light. A smaller number (like 100) is less sensitive 
            and can handle brighter light (like daylight). In contrast, a higher number (like 3200) is more 
            sensitive and can handle dimmer light (like low light and nighttime). If you need to use a 
            specific aperture and/or shutter speed, but the subject is getting washed out or too dark to see, 
            then a decrease or increase in the ISO’s sensitivity will be needed. This is especially helpful 
            in different lighting situations that are particularly dim or bright.

        <p><b>Do you like images with selective focus?</b></p>
        <p>I enjoy selective focus because it creates a unique fuzzy/bokeh affect behind the subject that 
            causes it to stand out more clearly. Additionally, manual focus allows me a great range of 
            focusing distances: foreground, middle ground, or background.

        <figcaption>ISO 100 f7.1 1/80</figcaption>
        <p><b>Are long time exposures interesting to you? Why?</b></p>
        <p>Long exposures are fascinating because of the special affects they achieve, some being the soft 
            fuzzy affect of blurred lights and movements, sharper lighter in dark scenes, and crisper 
            colors and subjects in still images.
        </p>
        <p><b>Find and post examples of images that you would like to make and discuss them?</b></p>
        <p>I did a few simple Google searches of various photograph types, and selected a few inspiring 
            ones that really stuck out to me.
        </p>
        <img src="MUL105blog_Images/LongExposure-Car.jpeg" alt="Car in Busy Town" class="img">
        <figcaption style="font-size:7pt;">"Here's How To Master The Art of Long Exposure Photography." Format.com. February 20, 2019. 
            <br><a href="https://www.format.com/magazine/resources/photography/long-exposure-photography" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color:black;">https://www.format.com/magazine/resources/photography/long-exposure-photography</a>. Accessed May 26, 2021</figcaption>
        <p>This photo is an exciting example of a long exposure in a nighttime scene. The exposure time 
            unnaturally brightens the stationery lights of the lampposts and streaks the moving 
            lights of the car. The bright lights in this scene create a sense of busy-ness and action 
            characteristic of a metropolis city; yet, there seems to be something more to the focus of 
            this picture because of the building with the peaked roof that my eyes are drawn to. The 
            colors of this picture (blue, white, and orange) seem to complement each other in a mix of 
            warm and cool colors.

        <p>This picture utilizes a long depth of field. Although the planks closest to the camera are the 
            most in focus, the rest of the scene has surprising focus and clarity as well. The rule 
            of thirds is played out well, and the dock leads my eye to the sun, the point of focus. 
            The lateral planks of the dock, the flat horizon line and the streaked clouds lend uniform 
            horizontal lines throughout the picture. The soft water, sun and sky also create a sense of calmness.

        <p>Not only does this photo freeze a bird in flight with a fast shutter speed, it also blurs out the 
            scenery in the background, creating a strong focus on the bird. The tail feathers and wings 
            draw the eye in to the bird’s face and body, and create a fascinating feeling of curiosity and movement.

        <p>I was intrigued by the way this photo has a string of lights that gets progressively fuzzier as the 
            lights dangle farther away from the camera. The string of lights seem rather haphazardly strewn 
            around the image, but it looks really cool against an almost completely black background (which 
            makes the lights seem to float in the darkness of the image). This photograph has a very shallow 
            depth of field and a great way of getting the light to look fuzzy and warm. I also find it fascinating 
            that although the background lights are only dots of light, they are not fuzzy dots of light, but 
            rather quite crisp and defined dots.

        <p>Taking pictures of faces (and getting them to look good) seems to be the hardest challenge I have 
            faced when photographing. Due to this fact and others, I have not been particularly interested 
            in portrait photography. Yet, I was able to find a genre of portrait photography that I do 
            enjoy immensely: family portraits. This genre is especially meaningful and interesting to me 
            because of the fond memories I’ve had of getting my family’s pictures taken during holidays, 
            birthdays, graduations or other special events. There’s something about family photos that 
            attracts me – maybe the way it captures their personalities or the special sense of family bonds and love.

        <p>There are so many extraordinary family photographers ‘out there’ that it was hard to pick 
            just one to write about. I ended up choosing a lady by the name of <a href="https://www.laurasantosphotography.com/" target="_blank" style="color:black;">Laura Santos</a>. I think she 
            stuck out to me because she lives only a few hours away, all of her gallery photos on her 
            website are beautiful, and she appears very friendly and relatable – the kind of person who 
            I would want to be as a photographer.
        </p>
        <p>Laura Santos lives and works out of Portland, Oregon. She mainly photographs families, 
            babies, children, and weddings – and has done so for the past ten years. A website post from 
            The Local Arrow entitled “12 Family Photographers We’re Loving in Oregon + Southwest 
            Washington” described her by saying, “Laura Santos has an incredible eye for capturing joy 
            and emotion in her family sessions. She balances color and light so well in her images and 
            uses depth of field in a brilliant way.”

        <p>To be honest, I personally don’t have the eye to be able to tell how/if her work is more distinct 
            than any other professional family photographer, but I do love what I see in her style. 
            Her pictures are upbeat, sunny, cheerful, simple, and crisp. She utilizes natural lighting and 
            many of her family pictures are taken outdoors. I like how she plays with light really well – often 
            with soft shadows, bright sunshine in the corner of a picture, background bokeh effects, and more. 
            Her photos also seem very soft and meaningful. She does a great job of capturing staged and un-staged 
            photos in a natural way that helps the families’ personalities shine.

        <p>An interesting part of family photography is getting along with the people you are 
            photographing and helping them feel comfortable in front of the camera. Working 
            on location can be tricky especially with tree shadows, sun positions, and wiggly 
            kids. Helping families get great photos that look natural can be tricky, but I feel 
            that it would be exciting and fulfilling to get to work with people in this fun way.
        </p>
        <p>Although I don’t foresee myself becoming a professional family photographer by any means, 
            I certainly hope to expand my skills to a level where I can become exceedingly proficient 
            in using my camera in my future career and for personal uses like family photos, events, 
            parties, snapshots of life, etc. I love the emotion and essence that family portraits 
            capture - a moment in time that won’t last long because time flies by too fast. Even if 
            I end up just photographing for a multimedia job, I really hope that I would be able to 
            incorporate Laura’s positive, meaningful, and soft picture style.

        <p>The final project for my MUL 105: Digital Photography class was a collection of themed photographs. 
            I chose to theme my photographs with the common color white, taking close-up pictures of everyday 
            objects around my house. Achieving the proper white balance, focus, and lighting was a challenge; 
            but I enjoyed this project and learned a lot along the way.

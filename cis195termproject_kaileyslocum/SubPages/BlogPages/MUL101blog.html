        <h1>MUL 101: Introduction to Media Arts</h1>
        <h2 style="font-size: 30px; padding-left:10px;">Lane Community College, Fall Term 2019</h2>
        <p>I took this class under ProfessorTeresa Hughes, Media Arts Faculty and Media Arts 
            Cooperative Education Coordinator. I learned basic experience in audio mixing, 
            movie production, research, and other media tools, documenting each assignment 
            in a Wordpress site that I created. I re-posted those blog posts into this web page. Enjoy!

        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Kailey Slocum. I have also been called 'Rapunzel's cousin' because I had four feet 
            and eleven inches of hair before I cut it and donated thirty inches to an organization 
            called Children with Hair Loss.
        </p>
        <p>There are so many hobbies I enjoy, and only a few of them are: paper crafting, reading books, 
            listening to music, writing in journals, riding horses, drawing, and taking photos with 
            my point-and-shoot camera which I've had since I was about ten. Most of all, I like to make 
            things look good, whether it be setting the table for Thanksgiving dinner, organizing papers, 
            arranging home decor, or designing cards on PicMonkey.
        </p>
        <p>Here are Lane Community College, I am currently working towards the Associate of Arts Oregon
            Transfer degree and the Associate of Arts Multimedia Design degree. I chose Multimedia Design
            because of its combination of media. As I learn a variety of skills, I am hoping to find my niche!
            Although I would like to put my associates degree to use as soon as I graduate from LCC, I may end up
            transferring to a university instead so that I can receive a Bachelor of Arts.

        <h2 id="Review">Reviewing an Online Blog: Depositphotos</h2>
        <img src="MUL101blog_Images/Home.png" style="width: 400px;" alt="Website page" class="img">
        <p>When I was about ten, I bought myself a little camera and took it with me 
            all over the place, snapping shots of my life. I still love taking photos 
            to capture special moments and to just be creative!
        </p>
        <p>Although I am undecided as to what specific career in multimedia design I want to pursue, 
            I am interested in photography and I find inspiration when looking at others' works of art, 
            something that isn't lacking in the website I found.
        </p>
        <img src="MUL101blog_Images/Logo.png" style="width: 400px;" alt="Depositphotos logo" class="img">
        <p><a href="https://depositphotos.com/" target="_blank" style="color:black;">Depositphotos</a> is a website where you can 
            "download more than 130 million high-quality royalty-free stock images 
            and high-definition footage." It provides pictures, news images, 
            illustrations, and videos that you can buy or simply browse through.
        </p>
        <p>If you are like me and aren't interested in buying images, Depositphotos also 
            offers a free option! By simply creating an account on their website, 
            you can receive free weekly stock photo downloads or sign up for informational e-mails!
        </p>
        <img src="MUL101blog_Images/Blog3.png" style="width: 400px;" alt="Depositphotos blog" class="img">
        <p>At the bottom of the website page under a list entitled DEPOSITPHOTOS is a link 
            to the <a href="https://blog.depositphotos.com/" target="_blank" style="color:black;">Depositphotos Blog</a>. From photography 
            and design to business and marketing, these blogs provide inspiration, 
            up-to-date news, and artistic advice. For example, one blog category includes

            and another includes fascinating interviews of professional photographers. 
            Depositphotos Blog makes it easy for you to blog on their website, and to learn

            simple links on their website.

        <p>I never thought of working with audio as especially fun, but just because I 
            may not be skilled at it doesn't mean I can't have fun with it! I'm finding 
            that, as my homework projects are taking me out of my comfort zone, 
            I am actually enjoying branching out to work with different types of media!
        </p>
        <p>Choosing the subjet of my audio project took a lot of thought. I had several 
            exciting ideas, but none of them seemed 'do-able' enough until I settled 
            on a simply Aesop's fable entitled "The Ants and the Grasshopper." I had 
            grown up listening to and reading many variations of this story, so I was 
            excited to make my own spin on it!
        </p>
        <p>I enjoyed this story for many reasons. Technically, there's only two main characters: 
            the group of ants, and the grasshopper! Yet, the story itself has the versatility 
            to be adapted with different characters and settings and still convey the same 
            ideas. In regards to the 'moral of the story,' I enjoy how this fable 
            emphasizes the importance of being prompt and prepared. Unfortunately, 
            procrastination is something I struggle with!
        </p>
        <p>I enjoyed writing the script and recording my voice (and my siblings' 
            voices) as well. My script ended up being way too long by the time 
            I had put all the audio together in Audition, so this version is 
            about half the size of the original! Working on this project also 
            took me much longer than I had planned; time was short, so I hope 
            to keep working on the audio in the future to make it better.
        </p>
        <img src="MUL101blog_Images/Grasshopper.jpg" alt="The Ants and the Grasshopper" class="img"><br>
        <p>As I searched for a picture for my video, I realized that the one I wanted 
            to use was most likely copyrighted. So, I just drew my own version 
            of the picture instead!

        <h2 id="Senses">Image Editing: The Five Senses</h2>
        <p>Creating a video project about the number 5 seemed challenging. After all, 
            not many things come in sets of five... So I settled on the simple 
            5 Senses: Touch, Smell, Hear, Taste, and See.
        </p>
        <embed width="500" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tg1KoVjXshU"></embed>
        <p>I enjoyed working with this topic because the Five Senses is something that 
            often seems under-appreciated. Just brainstorming about the five things 
            I love about each of the five senses reminded me of how much I use them 
            (and overlook them) every day!
        </p>
        <p>When the time came to start creating my video, I first started with the audio. 
            I recorded my voice, and then created a <i>long</i> checklist of all of 
            the things I would need to take pictures of. I noticed that a lot of my 
            pictures were "zoomed-in." I should have balanced them with more distant 
            shots, but I really enjoyed the challenge of getting new, <i>close</i> 
            perspectives of everyday items around my house.       
        </p>
        <p>At one point during the day, I went on a relaxing, long walk around the 
            neighborhood to capture some photo and video footage of the beautiful 
            fall trees and some of the last few flowers in bloom. The weather was 
            cold, but the light gray clouds were perfect for the lighting of my pictures. 
            On the other hand, taking pictures of the food was by far the hardest job; 
            I'd much rather eat food than photograph it!
        </p>
        <p>Using Premiere Pro to compile this video was fun; I fell in love with it 
            after getting introduced to it in the Time-Based Tools class. Although 
            I'm an amateur, I love to use Premiere Pro to renovate old homemade 
            video projects I've done a long time ago. Each time I use it, I keep learning.
        </p>
        <p>If I had extra time and energy for my video project, I would have worked 
            on my lettering and fonts in more detail because strangely, my words 
            were blurry in Premiere Pro. I was worried, but thankfully, they 
            they appeared rather normal in the exported video.
        </p>
        <p>So here it is! I hope you enjoy this video and won't forget just how amazing 
            it is to be able to touch, smell, hear, taste, and see!

        <h2 id="Slow">Final Project: Slowing Down</h2>
        <p>Slowing Down to Appreciate the Little Things</p>
        <p>So often we get caught up in the speed of life and forget to take time 
            to enjoy the little things. I put this video together to try to capture 
            that concept. The first half of it is about some of the many ways we rush. 
            The second half is about some of the wonderful things we miss when we rush 
            - the beautiful, slow, time-taking, rewarding activities we don't always do.
        </p>
        <embed width="500" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkxPreL6x88"></embed>
        <p>I was thinking of putting together this video in a <i>‘this versus that’</i> format, 
            but then I changed my mind. (For example: driving <i>versus</i> walking, 
            laundry machines <i>versus</i> a clothesline, texting <i>versus</i> talking in 
            person or sending a physical letter, heating up an instant microwave meal 
            <i>versus</i> making 
            a home-cooked dinner, etc.) Brainstorming for this project sure was fun!
        </p>
        <p>Even in the middle of putting together this video, I caught myself trying to speed along. 
            Instead of gettin impatient when the computer was slow, I had to remind myself to sit back and relax!
        </p>
        <p>Like usual, this project had its ups and downs, but overall, I enjoyed putting it together. 
            It was very difficult to find the video footage I wanted because strangers don't like 
            being videoed in the background, so I ended up getting some other shots instead. 
            One of my siblings was especially helpful in volunteering to be in my video footage, 
            so I really appreciate her help! Also, I used her camera for all of the videos and 
            pictures I've taken for my class projects.
        </p>
        <p>Like I have with all of my other projects, I used a snowball mic from the Media 
            Checkout Counter to record my voice. Unfortunately, the audio seemed a lot 
            fuzzier this time! I hope it wasn't becaue of the specific mic I was using!
        </p>
        <p>So, the moral of the story is: I encourage you to slow down and pay attention 
            to the little things! Give someone a smile, let a ladybug crawl on your finger, 
            and drive the speed limit for once. The world is only getting faster, so 
            don't wear yourself out trying to keep up with it!
